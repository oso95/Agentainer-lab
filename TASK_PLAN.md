# Agentainer Production Enhancement Task Plan

## Progress Summary
- **EPIC 1**: Network Architecture Refactor ✅ COMPLETED
- **EPIC 2**: Request Persistence & Replay ✅ COMPLETED  
- **EPIC 3**: Repository Structure Cleanup ✅ COMPLETED

## Overview
Transform Agentainer from a proof-of-concept to a production-ready, comprehensive open-source container runtime for LLM agents.

## Core Security Principles
1. **Zero Trust Architecture**: No agent trusts another agent by default
2. **Complete Isolation**: Agents cannot see or access other agents' data
3. **Defense in Depth**: Multiple security layers at network, storage, and application levels
4. **Least Privilege**: Each component has minimum required permissions
5. **Audit Everything**: All actions are logged and traceable

## Phase 1: Core Infrastructure Improvements

### 1.1 Network Architecture Refactor ✅ COMPLETED (EPIC 1)
**Priority: HIGH**
- [x] Remove direct port exposure (9000-9999 range)
- [x] Create internal Docker network (`agentainer-network`)
- [x] All agent access through proxy only
- [x] Implement service discovery between agents
- [x] Container-to-container communication support

**Implementation Details:**
- Modify `internal/agent/agent.go` to remove port bindings
- Update proxy handler to use container names/IDs
- Add network creation in manager initialization
- Update CLI to remove port display for direct access

### 1.2 YAML-Based Deployment (Optional Advanced Feature)
**Priority: MEDIUM**
- [ ] Add --config flag to existing deploy command
- [ ] Support YAML configuration files as optional alternative
- [ ] Batch deployment of multiple agents from single YAML
- [ ] Environment variable substitution
- [ ] Validation command for checking YAML files
- [ ] Keep simple CLI as primary interface

**YAML Format Example (for --config flag):**
```yaml
apiVersion: agentainer/v1
kind: AgentDeployment
metadata:
  name: my-agent-stack
spec:
  agents:
    - name: llm-processor
      image: my-llm:latest
      replicas: 3
      env:
        MODEL_NAME: gpt-4
        API_KEY: ${SECRET_API_KEY}
      resources:
        memory: 2Gi
        cpu: 1000m
      volumes:
        - host: ./models
          container: /app/models
          readOnly: true
      healthCheck:
        endpoint: /health
        interval: 30s
      persistence:
        enabled: true
        retryPolicy: exponential
    - name: vector-db
      image: qdrant:latest
      env:
        COLLECTION: embeddings
      dependencies:
        - llm-processor
```

**CLI Commands:**
- `agentainer deploy --name my-agent --image nginx:latest` - Simple deployment (existing)
- `agentainer deploy --config agents.yaml` - Deploy from YAML file (new option)
- `agentainer validate -f agents.yaml` - Validate YAML configuration (optional)

### 1.3 Storage Layer Enhancement
**Priority: HIGH**
- [ ] Replace file-based storage with proper database
- [ ] Implement storage interface for pluggable backends
- [ ] Add PostgreSQL driver
- [ ] Add etcd driver for distributed deployments
- [ ] Migration tools for existing deployments

### 1.4 Security Hardening
**Priority: CRITICAL**
- [ ] Replace demo authentication with proper auth system
- [ ] Implement JWT-based authentication
- [ ] Add role-based access control (RBAC)
- [ ] Per-agent access tokens
- [ ] API rate limiting
- [ ] TLS/SSL support
- [ ] Secrets management for agent env vars

### 1.5 Proxy-Level Request Persistence & Replay ✅ COMPLETED (EPIC 2)
**Priority: HIGH**
- [x] Implement request/response logging at proxy layer
- [x] Per-agent request queue with persistent storage
- [x] Request deduplication and idempotency keys
- [x] Automatic replay on agent recovery
- [ ] Configurable retry policies and backoff
- [x] Request status tracking (pending/processing/completed/failed)
- [x] Response caching for completed requests
- [ ] Dead letter queue for failed requests

**Implementation Details:**
- Modify `proxyToAgentHandler` to intercept and store requests
- Add request ID generation for tracking
- Store in Redis with agent-specific queues: `agent:{id}:requests:pending`
- Background worker to monitor agent health and replay requests
- API endpoints to view/manage request queues
- Optional: webhook notifications for request status changes

**Security Requirements:**
- Request data stored ONLY in Agentainer infrastructure storage
