# EPIC 2: Request Persistence Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented proxy-level request persistence and automatic replay mechanism for Agentainer. This feature ensures reliable message delivery to agents without requiring any changes to agent implementations.

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. Request Storage
- Requests sent to stopped/unavailable agents are automatically stored in Redis
- Each agent has its own request queue (`agent:{id}:requests:pending`)
- Requests include full HTTP details (method, path, headers, body)
- Automatic request ID generation for tracking

### 2. Automatic Replay
- Background replay worker monitors agent status changes every 5 seconds
- When an agent starts, pending requests are automatically replayed
- Replay uses the proxy endpoint to ensure proper routing
- Prevents duplicate storage of replayed requests

### 3. CLI Integration
- New `agentainer requests [agent-id]` command to view pending requests
- Shows request details including ID, method, path, status, and timestamp
- Integrates seamlessly with existing CLI structure

### 4. Request Lifecycle
- **Pending**: Initial state when request is stored
- **Processing**: Request is being replayed (not yet implemented)
- **Completed**: Request successfully delivered and response stored
- **Failed**: Request failed after max retries

## Technical Implementation

### New Components
1. **internal/requests/requests.go**
   - Request/Response structs
   - Manager for storage operations
   - Redis-based persistence

2. **internal/requests/replay_worker.go**
   - Background worker for automatic replay
   - Agent status monitoring
   - HTTP request reconstruction and replay

3. **Request Interception**
   - Modified proxy handler to intercept requests
   - Store requests when agents are unavailable
   - Track request IDs through headers

### Configuration
```yaml
features:
  request_persistence: true
```

## Testing
Created comprehensive test scripts:
- `test-persistence-final.sh`: Complete end-to-end test
- `test-replay-debug.sh`: Debug replay functionality
- `test-persistence-quick.sh`: Quick validation test

## Benefits
1. **Reliability**: No lost requests when agents are temporarily unavailable
2. **Transparency**: Works at infrastructure level, no agent changes needed
3. **Observability**: View and track pending requests
4. **Flexibility**: Can be enabled/disabled via configuration

## Future Enhancements
1. Add request retry limits and backoff strategies
2. Implement request expiration/TTL
3. Add metrics for request success/failure rates
4. Support for request priority queuing
5. Web UI for request monitoring

## Usage Example
```bash
# Deploy agent (not started)
agentainer deploy --name my-agent --image myapp:latest

# Send request while stopped (will be queued)
curl http://localhost:8081/agent/{agent-id}/api/endpoint

# Check pending requests
agentainer requests {agent-id}

# Start agent (requests replay automatically)
agentainer start {agent-id}
```

This implementation provides a solid foundation for reliable agent communication in Agentainer.
