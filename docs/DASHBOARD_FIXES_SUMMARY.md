# Dashboard Fixes Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Template Field Reference Error
**Issue**: The workflow-detail.html template was trying to access fields that didn't exist in WorkflowMetrics struct:
```
executing "content" at <.Metrics.TotalSteps>: can't evaluate field TotalSteps in type *workflow.WorkflowMetrics
```

**Root Cause**: The template expected fields like `TotalSteps`, `CompletedSteps`, `FailedSteps`, and `Duration` directly on the WorkflowMetrics struct, but these needed to be calculated from the StepMetrics map.

**Fix**: Modified the dashboard handler to calculate these metrics and pass them as a separate struct:
- Count total steps from `len(metrics.StepMetrics)`
- Count completed/failed steps by iterating through step statuses
- Format duration properly
- Pass calculated metrics to template

### 2. Workflow Status Not Updating in Real-Time
**Issue**: Workflows showed as "running" in the dashboard even after completion or failure.

**Root Cause**: 
- No real-time update mechanism for workflow status changes
- Page only auto-refreshed every 5 seconds for running workflows
- No WebSocket integration for live updates

**Fix**: Implemented real-time workflow updates via WebSocket:
1. Added Redis pub/sub for workflow updates in `SaveWorkflow` method
2. Created `listenForWorkflowUpdates` in dashboard server to subscribe to updates
3. Enhanced workflow-detail.html with WebSocket connection for live updates
4. WebSocket automatically reconnects if disconnected
5. Fallback to periodic refresh if WebSocket fails

### 3. Missing WebSocket Update Broadcasting
**Issue**: Workflow status changes weren't being broadcasted to connected clients.

**Fix**: 
- Added Redis publish on every workflow save
- Dashboard server subscribes to `workflow:updates` channel
- Updates are forwarded to all WebSocket clients
- Client-side JavaScript refreshes page on relevant updates

## Technical Changes

### Files Modified:

1. **internal/dashboard/server.go**
   - Updated `handleWorkflowDetail` to calculate metrics
   - Added `listenForWorkflowUpdates` method
   - Integrated workflow update listener in `Start` method

2. **internal/workflow/workflow.go**
   - Modified `SaveWorkflow` to publish updates via Redis
   - Publishes to `workflow:updates` channel with workflow data

3. **internal/dashboard/templates/workflow-detail.html**
   - Added WebSocket connection logic
   - Implements auto-reconnect on disconnect
   - Refreshes page when workflow updates are received
   - Maintains fallback refresh for reliability

## How It Works Now

1. **Workflow Updates**: When a workflow status changes, it's saved to Redis and a notification is published
2. **Dashboard Subscription**: The dashboard server subscribes to workflow updates 
3. **WebSocket Broadcast**: Updates are forwarded to all connected WebSocket clients
4. **Client Refresh**: The workflow detail page refreshes when it receives an update for its workflow
5. **Metrics Display**: Calculated metrics (total/completed/failed steps, duration) are shown correctly

## Testing

To verify the fixes:
1. Start a workflow: `./run_llm_workflow.py`
2. Open the workflow detail page in the dashboard
3. Watch as the status updates in real-time without manual refresh
4. Check the browser console for WebSocket connection logs
5. Metrics section should display correctly without template errors

## Benefits

- **Real-time Updates**: No more stale workflow statuses
- **Better UX**: Users see immediate feedback on workflow progress
- **Reliable**: WebSocket with automatic reconnection and fallback
- **Accurate Metrics**: Properly calculated and displayed workflow metrics
- **No Manual Refresh**: Dashboard stays current automatically
